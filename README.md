# Voting System API - README

## Introduction

This document describes the implementation of a voting system where each voter can distribute a total of **10 votes** among all candidates, with certain rules and constraints to ensure fairness and reduce the risk of manipulation by bad actors. The system also incorporates mechanisms to handle **ties** and **strategic voting** by leveraging voter uniqueness and score adjustments.

## Voting Rules

### Key Voting Constraints:
1. **Total Votes per Voter:** 
   - Each voter is given **10 votes** to distribute among the candidates.

2. **Maximum Votes for a Single Candidate:** 
   - A voter can give **a maximum of 7 votes** to any **one candidate**.
   - This prevents a voter from giving all their votes to a single candidate, thus reducing the impact of voting blocks or strategic manipulation.

3. **Votes for "NOTA" (None of the Above):**
   - If a voter does not want to vote for any candidate, they can give **3 votes** to **NOTA**.
   - When a voter gives votes to NOTA, any votes they give to other candidates will be **adjusted** to reduce their impact. Specifically, if a voter gives 7 votes to a candidate along with 3 votes to NOTA, the 7 votes will be **multiplied by 0.8**, resulting in **6 effective votes** for that candidate.
   - This adjustment discourages strategic voters from gaming the system by reducing the effect of their vote when NOTA is used.

4. **Handling Tied Scores:**
   - In case of a tie between two or more candidates based on the total vote count, we will use the number of **unique voters** as the tie-breaking mechanism.
   - The candidate with more **unique voters** will be considered the winner, ensuring that broader support across the voter base is recognized.

### Voting Flow Summary:
- Voters are allowed to distribute their votes across candidates with the rules above.
- If votes are tied between candidates, the system checks which candidate has more unique voters to break the tie.

## Example Voting Scenarios

1. **Voter 1:**
   - 7 votes to Candidate A
   - 3 votes to Candidate B
   - Total votes: 7 + 3 = 10 votes

2. **Voter 2 (using NOTA):**
   - 7 votes to Candidate A
   - 3 votes to NOTA
   - The votes to Candidate A will be reduced to **6 votes** (7 votes * 0.8 = 6).

3. **Voter 3:**
   - 5 votes to Candidate B
   - 5 votes to Candidate C
   - Total votes: 5 + 5 = 10 votes

4. **Voter 4:**
   - 6 votes to Candidate C
   - 4 votes to Candidate D
   - Total votes: 6 + 4 = 10 votes

In this system, **NOTA** impacts the final vote tally by adjusting the votes given to other candidates, ensuring that any voter who partially opts out (by selecting NOTA) has a reduced influence on the overall outcome.

## Tiebreaker Example:
Letâ€™s assume two candidates, Candidate A and Candidate B, end up with the same number of votes. To decide the winner, we count how many **unique voters** voted for each candidate:
- If Candidate A had votes from 50 unique voters and Candidate B had votes from 45 unique voters, **Candidate A** would win because they received votes from more unique voters.
  
This ensures that the candidate with wider overall support is declared the winner.

## Features and Advantages of the System

1. **Prevents Vote Manipulation:**
   - By limiting the maximum number of votes a voter can give to a single candidate, the system discourages vote-stacking or strategic voting that could give an unfair advantage to any candidate.
   
2. **Incorporates "None of the Above" (NOTA):**
   - Allows voters to express dissatisfaction with all candidates by selecting NOTA, while ensuring their other votes are reduced in impact to prevent strategic abuse of NOTA.

3. **Fairness in Tie-Breaking:**
   - The use of **unique voter counts** as a tiebreaker ensures that candidates with broader, more diverse support win, even when vote totals are tied.

## API Endpoints

Here are the backend API endpoints that support this voting system:

1. **Create a New Voting Room**
   - **POST /voting-room**
   - Description: Creates a new voting room for an election.

2. **Add a New Candidate**
   - **POST /voting-room/{id}/add-candidate**
   - Description: Adds a candidate to the voting room.

3. **Add a New Voter**
   - **POST /voting-room/{id}/add-voter**
   - Description: Registers a new voter to participate in the election.

4. **Cast Votes**
   - **POST /voting-room/{id}/cast-vote**
   - Description: Allows a voter to cast their 10 votes according to the defined rules (maximum 7 votes for a single candidate, NOTA rules, etc.).

5. **Check Results**
   - **GET /voting-room/{id}/results**
   - Description: Returns the results of the election, including total votes for each candidate and NOTA, along with the number of unique voters for each candidate (to handle tiebreakers).
